# `Express Generator CLI for Node with Typescript, Apollo GraphQL Server and MongoDB with Mongoose`

This CLI helps to create new implemented API demo for Node with Typescript, Apollo GraphQL Server and MongoDB with Mongoose from a boilerplate.

## `About the NPM Package`
### Package Installation
```sh
npm install -g express-generator-node-typescript-apollo-graphql-mongo-cli
```

### Package Usage
Go to the directory on terminal where you want to generate the project.
```sh
$ cd PATH
```
and run the generator command with specifying the project name.
```sh
$ express-generator-ntagm --name="PROJECT_NAME"
```

## `Documentation for the Boilerplate`
When you generate the project, you will have;

### Tech Stack

* [Node.js]
* [Typescript]
* [GraphQL Apollo Server]
* MongoDB with [Mongoose]

### Features

* Multiple GraphQL Queries with implementations in Typescript
* Multiple GraphQL Mutations with implementations in Typescript
* Multiple GraphQL Schemas with implementations in Typescript
* Multiple Controllers with implementations in Typescript
* Multiple Mongoose Models with implementations in Typescript
* MongoDB Connection, Repository Layer implementations in Typescript
* CRUD operations for Multiple Entities with implementations in Typescript

### Architecture
This boilerplate has common graphql api design architecture. 
**Layers:**
* ***Controllers*** holds implementation for the business logic, like retrieving data from repositories, 
returning those data to queries and mutations, saving data etc.
* ***Database*** holds MongoDB connection provider
* ***Models*** holds document interfaces, schema definitions and models for MongoDB & Mongoose
* ***Mutations*** holds basic mutation implementation; create, update, delete
* ***Queries*** holds basic query implementation; retrieve
* ***Resolvers*** holds resolver definitions for Apollo Server
* ***Schemas*** holds schema definitions for Apollo Server

### Installation
Install the dependencies and devDependencies:

```sh
$ cd <Project Name>
$ npm install
```

Set environment parameters on **.env**:
```sh
PORT="{{PORT NUMBER WHERE THE APP WILL WORK}}"
MONGO_DB_PATH="{{MONGODB CONNECTION URL STRING}}"
```

And that's all, start the server
```sh
$ npm start
```

## `Documentation for the Generator Project`
### Tech Stack
* [Node.js]
* [Typescript]

### Plugins

**express-generator-ntagm** is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | Usage |
| ------ | ------ |
| [ejs] | to render global parameters like Project Name |
| [inquirer] | to ask questions and parse input |
| [shelljs] | to eliminate your shell script's dependency on Unix |
| [yargs] | to build interactive command line tools |
| [shx] | to wrap around ShellJS Unix commands |
| [ts-node] | to execute TypeScript and REPL for node.js, with source map support |


### Installation
**express-generator-ntagm** requires [Node.js] v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the application.

```sh
$ cd express-generator-node-typescript-apollo-graphql-mongo
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

To install the CLI globally:
```sh
$ npm run-script build
$ npm install -g .
```

And global usage:
```sh
$ express-generator-ntagm --name="PROJECT_NAME"
```
